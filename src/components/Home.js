            <span>
                Hi, I'm a Full Stack Web Developer. I have been studying programming since 2017 and Iâ€™m willing to keep learning new languages, 
                tools. As a goal I want to become a Senior Developer able to guide teams and share ideas with others.

                Among my strengths are discipline, interest for coding, high self teaching capability, and eagerness to learn from others.
